Relaunch
========

Relaunch is a 2 foot UI utility to add a new tile to the Extras Library of Windows Media Center. It requires the .net framework 4.x. All it really does is write an autoit script, and an MCL file for you using [this method](http://techlifeweb.com/how-to-build-your-own-app-launcher-for-windows-media-center/).

The code is old and ugly, you have been warned.
